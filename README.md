Food Traceability

Today we are still not sure what we are eating. Especially this is true for so called premium or organic food. Is it really organic all the way from farm to fork. How do I know when I go to supermarket or to the local Farmer’s market that this food is organic or that is has some other attributes that I am looking for? The only tool that I as a consumer have right now is to read labels or believe in brands. I want to be able to see history of this specific piece of food that I am looking at and want to buy. Not the whole band or product in general but this particular piece for food. 

Workflow.
1.	Producer is preparing food for shipment – writes to blockchain info about how food is produced, when, who produced it and tracking number
2.	Optional: Logistics company(s) when delivering – writes to blockchain info when they picked up the food, from whom, when they delivered it, to whom.
3.	Customer goes to online store or supermarket or Farmer’s market
4.	Customer looks at the food he/she wants to buy
